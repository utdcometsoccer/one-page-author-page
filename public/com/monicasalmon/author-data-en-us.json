      "description": "A novel that questions the female double standard. Victoria starts an erotic relationship with her husband’s partner, to confirm the possibility of experiencing her sexuality without guilt and outside of the repressive patriarchal tradition. Victoria does end up undergoing a transformation, and is reborn with the aspirations that every woman should have. On a visit to her husband’s partner’s house, Victoria takes a peek around the place and finds herself in the master bedroom. The owner, Xavier Sanguinetti, is a famous, wealthy, attractive seducer, as well as “happily” married. A few days later, Xavier sits beside her at a lunch party. Victoria is aroused but uncomfortable when he slips his hand between her legs, and she hesitates but eventually just goes with it. While previously she had been proud of her faithfulness, she now decides to not resist him, and just enjoy. That day is followed by a couple more encounters, in which Victoria discovers physical feelings she had never known before. Soon he is teaching her, every night and every day, how to enjoy her body. With Xavier, she begins to question her role in her family and in society, and she opens up to the possibility of thinking of herself as someone different to the person she’d always been told her should be. However, Xavier shows his true nature when an attack of jealousy turns into a violent kidnapping.",
